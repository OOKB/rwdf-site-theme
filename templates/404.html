<p class="lead">Our server couldn’t find what you were looking for. The page or file might have been moved or been deleted. There might have been a bad link from elsewhere. You might just have a typo. It's not a big deal</p>

<p class="lead">Check for an obvious typo in the URL, as that’s the easiest thing to fix. If that’s not it then here are the cool things we’ve helped make happen, maybe what you were looking for is <a href="/whatwedo/">one of our project?</a></p>

<p class="lead">Otherwise, click around above, you should be able to find what you’re looking for pretty quickly. Or, you can <a href="mailto:info@rwdfoundation.org?subject=Something is Missing">email us</a> if you think what is missing is a serious problem.</p>
